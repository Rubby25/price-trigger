# Price Trigger

A decentralized smart contract system for automated price-based actions on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

Price Trigger is an innovative blockchain solution that enables smart contracts to respond dynamically to real-time price movements across various financial instruments and cryptocurrencies.

### Key Features

- Real-time price monitoring
- Configurable trigger conditions
- Automated contract execution
- Secure and transparent price tracking
- Cross-asset price interactions

## Smart Contracts

### Price Oracle (`price-oracle`)

Manages price data sources and validation mechanisms.

Key features:
- Multiple price feed integration
- Price validation and verification
- Source reputation tracking
- Historical price data storage

### Trigger Manager (`trigger-manager`)

Handles trigger configuration and management.

Key features:
- Custom trigger creation
- Condition definition
- Access control
- Trigger state management

### Price Listener (`price-listener`)

Monitors and processes incoming price updates.

Key features:
- Real-time price event processing
- Price change detection
- Event logging
- Performance optimization

### Trigger Execution (`trigger-execution`)

Executes predefined actions based on price triggers.

Key features:
- Conditional action execution
- Secure transaction processing
- Automated workflow management
- Comprehensive event tracking

## Getting Started

1. Deploy smart contracts to Stacks blockchain
2. Configure price data sources
3. Define trigger conditions
4. Set up execution parameters
5. Monitor and manage triggers

## Usage Example

```clarity
;; Create a price trigger for BTC/STX pair
(define-public (create-btc-stx-trigger)
  (contract-call? .trigger-manager create-trigger
    "BTC/STX Price Drop"
    {
      asset-pair: "BTC/STX",
      condition-type: "less-than",
      threshold-price: u50000,
      action: "sell-asset"
    }
  )
)
```

## Security Considerations

- Multi-signature trigger management
- Rate limiting on price updates
- Comprehensive access controls
- Secure oracle design
- Fail-safe mechanism implementation
